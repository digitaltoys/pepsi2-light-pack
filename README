Lightpack
=========

Lightpack is a very simple implementation of the backlight for a laptop (as in Philips TV). A couple of simple printed circuit boards, controller, shift registers, a few LEDs and lightpack is ready!   

Configuration program lives in the tray, without interfering with habitual work and watching movies.   

Hardware: AT90USB162, 2 x MBI5026 and 8 x RGB LEDs;
Firmware: LUFA, USB HID, PWM;
Software: C++, Qt4, hidapi;
