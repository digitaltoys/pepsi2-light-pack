AmbilightUSB
============

AmbilightUSB is a very simple implementation of the backlight for a laptop (as in Philips TV). A couple of simple printed circuit boards, controller, shift registers, a few LEDs and AmbilightUSB is ready!   

Configuration program lives in the tray, without interfering with habitual work and watching movies.   

**Hardware**: `ATtiny44`, `2 x 74HC595` and `4 x RGB LEDs`   
**Firmware**: written in `C`, using `V-USB` (HID Class device)   
**Software**: `C++`, `Qt` (all tested in Ubuntu 10.04)
